    hwin
    this is the HWND id of the cs go window
    we play in windowed rather than full screen mode
    e.g. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getforegroundwindow

    game_resolution=(1024,768)
    is the windowed resolution of the game
    I think could get away with game_resolution=(640,480)
    and should be quicker to grab from
    but for now, during development, I like to see the game in reasonable
    size

    SHOW_IMAGE
    whether to display the image. probably a bad idea to
    do that here except for testing
    better to use cv2.imshow('img',img) outside the funcion

    -- Outputs --
    currently this function returns img_small
    img is the raw capture image, in BGR
    img_small is a low res image, with the thought of
    using this as input to a NN
